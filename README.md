# TensorFlow, running a neural network on lattice data
The code provided is used to perform extrapolation of lattice data. It is well known that ML algorithms are poorly suited for extrapolation, but this example was meant as a check on a larger framework currently being developed by the EXCLusives via Artificial Intelligence and
Machine learning (EXCLAIM) collaboration.
